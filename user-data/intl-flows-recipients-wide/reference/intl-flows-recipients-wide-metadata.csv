"description","Estimates of resource flows into and out of each country. Estimates are gross inflows/outflows where available, with the following exceptions: foreign direct investment and portfolio equity are net inflows (new investments minus disinvestments) and short-term debt is net flows (disbursements minus principal repayments). See methodology for detailed notes on the data for each resource flow."
