"calculation","The sum of net inflows of FDI, remittances, gross ODA, gross OOFs, net inflows of portfolio equity, net short-term debt, long-term debt, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping. This series aims to estimate gross inflows so negative net inflows are excluded (set to zero). Data on peacekeeping is only available for 2012 and humanitarian assistance (excluding that reported as ODA to the OECD DAC) is only available from 2000-2012."
